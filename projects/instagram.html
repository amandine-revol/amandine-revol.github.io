                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>About the company</h2>
                    <p>
                        Levuro is a social media management tool that allows users to manage their social media 
                        (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, YouTube) in one place. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        More than half of Levuro users have an Instagram account.
                        Users can connect their Instagram profile to Levuro to schedule posts in advance. 
                        They need to define a publishing method: automatic or manual. Manual works with push notifications on their phone. Users can't create posts in Levuro without specifying this publishing method.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Several warnings led us to notice high pain points in the tool for users to define a publishing method for 
                        Instagram accounts leading to abandonment during onboarding and deletion of account: </p>
                   
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>An increased demand from users to have support to define a publishing method for Instagram.</li>
                        <li>Analytics showed that most users could not define a publishing method and could never use the tool.</li>
                        <li>Beta users left the program because of frustration to publish on Instagram.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>To stop losing more users, we grouped all the information we had to identify pain points 
                        patterns and reduce users' frustrations. </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The graphs below show that half of Levuro’s users have an Instagram account, 
                            but only 30% of these accounts have a publishing method for Instagram. 
                            It means that for all the Instagram accounts connected to Levuro, users can publish 
                            to Instagram only for 30% of these profiles. As a result, users are deleting their accounts.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        We changed the user flow to allow users to decide how they wanted to publish on social media. We re-wrote most of the text to provide users with more guidance and removed jargon. We also removed barriers to allow users to use Levuro and draft their posts before defining a publishing method.

                    <p>
                        As a solo UX designer, I managed the project by identifying the user's pain 
                        points and bringing them to the team's attention. I led additional 
                        research with usability testing, designed the new user flow and design 
                        improvements, organized cross-functional meetings to brainstorm and sync 
                        with the team, and made high-fidelity prototypes for hand-off to the development team.

            <h4>Research: user flow</h4>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Understanding how publishing to Instagram works through third party tools and API limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    There is 3 types of Instagram account:
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li><span class="bold">Business account</span></li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Private or creator account</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Depending on your account type you can publish your social media post automatically or 
                    manually with push notifications on your phone:
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li><span class="bold"> Automatically with auto-publishing</span> , it works only for Instagram 
                            business profiles. And the Instagram needs to be connected to a Facebook page.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Manually, using your phone</span>, we call it mobile notification publishing. 
                            When it’s time to publish they receive a notification on their phone to publish, 
                            it works for all Instagram profiles: private/creator and business.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="margin56">
                <img src="img/ig_api_old.png">
                <p>With the current user flow, we don't offer a way to use auto-publishing
                with a personal profile.

                <h2>Gathering data from beta users, usability testing, analytics, 
                    and customer support revealed multiple pain points and high frustration from users.</h2>
                <p>
                    During this research phase, we gathered all our data and ran additional usability tests to identify 
                    pain points and usability problems. We uncovered more than 10 bugs that were part of the usability problems, 
                    but the main pain point was in the user flow. Users struggle to 
                    understand what they must do to define a publishing method.</p>

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Users don’t know if their Instagram profile was connected to Levuro.</li>
                    <li>Users don’t understand why they must choose a publishing method immediately without initiating the action. Their main goal was still to connect their IG profile.</li>
                    <li>There is a lack of clarity in the modal dialogue. Most users could not understand what it was about or what they had to do, e.g. it needed to be more evident to users that for auto publishing to work, their Instagram profile needs to be connected to a Facebook page. It led users not understanding why it was not working and not knowing why.</li>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Giving users a choice on how they want to publish their posts and showing them the way to automatic publishing.</h2>
                <p>
                    Levuro is a scheduling tool to publish posts in advance. Users coming to the platform don’t want to publish manually. When possible, they want to do it automatically. We should inform them about the value of auto publishing and invite users to convert their personal profiles into Instagram business profiles. 
                </p><br>

                <p>Underneath are the new modal dialogs allowing users to choose how they want to publish. With the text, we explained the difference between the 2 methods and indicated what they needed to do.</p>

                <h2>Rewriting confusing modal dialog. </h2>

                <p>
                    Most users could not understand what was written, as a result the setting up of a publishing method often failed. 
                    Our goal rewriting modals were:
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>Guide users each step of the way to connect their profiles and define a publishing method.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove technical jargon to increase user confidence in completing the process.</li>
                        <li>Use a language that we use for talking that is dynamic and easy to understand.</li>
                        <li>                    Focus on writing clear and concise statements in case of errors or problems and provide a solution so the user can handle the situation.                            .</li>

                    </ul>
                    You can see below the modal before and after.

                <h2>Removing barriers: Allowing users to create their posts for social media and, only after, to select a publishing method.</h2>

                <p>
                    Letting users create the perfect social media post in Levuro and letting them define a publishing method when they wanted to schedule the post was more natural in the user flow. Plus, it gave the users motivation. Defining a publishing method would allow the user to publish the post he invested time in creating. 
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Users still have a reminder and the possibility to define a publishing method before they create their posts.

                    We removed the content on the right that was a repetition of the middle part. Instead, we invited the user to read our thorough help article about publishing to Instagram. And we mentioned that the support chat was available to help.

                <p class="margin20">We’ll keep monitoring the success rate to define a publishing method for Instagram users. Since the Instagram API is constantly changing, we need to ensure the process is still relevant and clear, e.g., since a few weeks, reels can be published automatically through third-party tools like Levuro. It means that we need to identify whether it requires any changes in the user flow and how to integrate this new functionality in this process, how to make users aware of it, and possible modification or creation of help articles.
