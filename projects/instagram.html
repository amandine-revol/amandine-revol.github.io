                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>About the company</h2>
                    <p>
                        Levuro is a social media and live stream management tool for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. Users can publish via web or mobile apps.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        More than half of Levuro’s users have Instagram accounts and expect automatic publishing, but many struggle to connect profiles and set up the correct publishing method. The complex flow leads to frustration and high churn, with users abandoning or deleting their accounts.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        I redesigned the user flow to make automatic publishing an option for all users, guiding them to convert their profiles to business accounts when needed. I simplified the setup process, rewrote the guidance text to be clear and jargon-free, and removed barriers so users could draft posts before selecting a publishing method. This allowed users more flexibility and control over how they publish their content.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the sole UX designer, I led user research, conducted usability testing, designed the new flow, and created high-fidelity prototypes. I collaborated with developers and stakeholders to ensure alignment and smooth implementation.
                        <br><br>

                        This project was collaborative and agile, with a cross-functional team (4 developers and the CEO). I leveraged everyone's expertise and knowledge to make the best decisions.

            <div class="block">
                <h2>How I discovered the problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    I presented the problem during monthly product discussions using data analytics, beta user feedback, and customer support reports to support the case. <span class="bold"> Key finding: 70% of Instagram users couldn’t publish posts through Levuro, leading to account deletions.</span>
                </p>
                <br>

            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>User Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    The graphs show that half of Levuro’s users have an Instagram account, but 70% of these accounts don’t have a publishing method for posting on Instagram. It means that out of all the Instagram accounts connected to Levuro, 70% can’t publish posts using Levuro. 
                    As a result, Instagram users are deleting their accounts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More than half of Levuro users have an Instagram account. High competition for social media tools made it critical to fix this issue. By improving the experience, we aimed to reduce churn and convert more users to paid accounts.

                <p>
                    There is 3 types of Instagram profiles:

                <h2>Through beta user feedback, usability testing, analytics, and customer support data, we identified multiple pain points and high user frustration. While we uncovered more than 10 bugs, the primary issue was confusion around the user flow for defining a publishing method for Instagram.</h2>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Finding 1: Users don’t understand why they need to define a publishing method for their Instagram profile, and those who attempt it struggle with the unclear instructions.</h2>
                
                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Users were unsure if their Instagram profile was properly connected to Levuro.</li>
                    <li>Many didn’t understand why they had to choose a publishing method immediately, as their main goal was simply to connect their profile.</li>
                    <li>Modal dialogues lacked clarity, particularly in explaining that auto-publishing requires an Instagram business profile connected to a Facebook page. This led to confusion, with users not knowing why the feature wasn’t working.

            3. <span class="bold">Allow post creation</span> even if the publishing method isn’t defined, so users can create drafts and set up publishing later.<br>
            4. <span class="bold">Add a feature for resending mobile notifications easily</span> from both the mobile app and web app, ensuring users can complete the publishing process.

                <p class="margin20">We will continue monitoring the success rate for Instagram publishing setup.

                <h2>Rewriting confusing modal dialog. </h2>

                <p>
                    Most users could not understand what was written, as a result the setting up of a publishing method often failed. 
                    My objective in rewriting the modal dialogs was to:
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>Guide users step by step in connecting their profiles and defining a publishing method.
                        </li>
                        <li>Eliminate technical jargon to boost user confidence.</li>
                        <li>Use dynamic, conversational language that’s easy to understand.</li>
                        <li>Ensure clear and concise error handling, offering solutions so users can resolve issues independently.</li>

                    </ul>
                    You can see below the modal before and after.
