                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>About the company</h2>
                    <p>
                        Levuro is a social media management platform and live stream management tool for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. Users can publish through the web app or the mobile app.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        More than half of Levuro users have an Instagram account, but we realized that many struggle to connect their Instagram profiles to Levuro and can’t define how to publish their posts. As a result, many users are abandoning the platform or deleting their accounts. Improving the user experience will help reduce customer churn, which is very high.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        We changed the user flow to allow users to decide how they wanted to publish on social media. We re-wrote most of the text to provide users with more guidance and removed jargon. We also removed barriers to allow users to use Levuro and draft their posts before defining a publishing method.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="block">
                    <h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a solo UX designer, I managed the project by identifying the user's pain points and bringing them to the team's attention and taking responsibility to fix it. I led additional research with usability testing, designed the new user flow and design improvements, organized cross-functional meetings to brainstorm and sync with the team, and made high-fidelity prototypes for hand-off to the development team.
                        <br><br>

                        This project was collaborative and agile, with a cross-functional team (2 developers, 1 CEO/ sales, and me). I leveraged everyone's expertise and knowledge to make the best decisions.

            <h4>Context</h4>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>How we discovered the problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    Once a month, the team meets to discuss how we could improve the product.
                    Several insights led me to think that something was wrong with our Instagram users and that we should investigate further:
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li><span class="bold">Beta users left the program because of frustration with publishing on Instagram.</span></li>
                        <li><span class="bold">There is a high demand from users for support in defining a publishing method for Instagram.</span></li>
                        <li><span class="bold">Data analytics revealed that Instagram users represented a big part of deleted accounts.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To stop losing more users, we grouped all the information we had to identify pain points patterns and reduce users' frustrations. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Impact on users</h2>
                <p>
                    The graphs show that half of Levuro’s users have an Instagram account, but 70% of these accounts don’t have a publishing method for posting on Instagram. It means that out of all the Instagram accounts connected to Levuro, 70% can’t publish posts using Levuro. 
                    As a result, Instagram users are deleting their accounts.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="margin56">
                <img src="img/ig_analytics1.png">
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Impact on the business</h2>
                <p>
                    More than half of Levuro users have an Instagram account. We are now losing a lot of them. The competition for social media tools is very high. If they can’t publish to Instagram easily, they will switch to another tool.
                    By improving the user experience, we will reduce churn and grow the number of users that might convert to a paid account.

                <p>
                    For each new project, we start with discovery work. In a shared Google document, we define:

            <h2>Publishing to Instagram through third-party tools and API limitations</h2>

            <div class="block">
                <p>
                    There is 3 types of Instagram profiles:
                </p>
                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Business account</li>

                <p>
                    Depending on your profile type, you can publish your social media post automatically or manually with push notifications on your phone:
                </p>
                <ul class="square">
                    <li><span class="bold">Automatically with auto-publishing</span>, it works only for Instagram business profiles. And the Instagram profile needs to be connected to a Facebook page.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Manually, using their phone</span>, we call it mobile notification publishing. When it’s time to publish, they receive a notification on their phone to publish, it works for all Instagram profiles: private/creator and business.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Research: Gathering insights</h4>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Gathering data from beta users, usability testing, analytics, and customer support revealed multiple pain points and high frustration from users.</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I used different methods to gather insights: 
                </p>
                <ul class="square">
                    <li>User feedback from customer support</li>
                    <li>Usability testing and user interview</li>
                    <li>Analyze user session recording</li>
                </ul><br>

                <p><span class="bold">We uncovered more than 10 bugs that were part of the usability problems, but the main pain point was in the user flow. Users struggle to understand what they must do to define a publishing method.</span></p>
            </div>

            <h4>Research insights</h4>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>Finding 1: Users don’t understand why they must define a publishing method for their Instagram profile. The few users trying to accomplish it struggle to follow and understand the instructions.</h2>
                
                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Users don’t know if their Instagram profile is connected to Levuro.</li>
                    <li>Users don’t understand why they must choose a publishing method immediately without initiating the action. Their main goal was still to connect their IG profile.</li>
                    <li>There is a lack of clarity in the modal dialogue. Most users could not understand what it was about or what they had to do, e.g. it needed to be more evident to users that for auto publishing to work, their Instagram profile needs to be connected to a Facebook page. It led to users not understanding why it was not working and not knowing why.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Removing barriers: Allowing users to create their posts for social media even without a publishing method.</h2>

                <p>
                    Letting users create the perfect social media post in Levuro and letting them define a publishing method when they wanted to schedule the post was more natural in the user flow. Plus, it gave the users motivation. Defining a publishing method would allow the user to publish the post he invested time in creating. 
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    Users still have a reminder and the possibility to define a publishing method before they create their posts.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    We removed the content on the right that was a repetition of the middle part. Instead, we invited the user to read our thorough help article about publishing to Instagram. And we mentioned that the support chat was available to help.

            <h4>Conclusion </h4>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>After 1 month of implementation:</h2>

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Help requests from users to schedule a publishing method for Instagram are significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Screen recordings shows that most users could resolve the issues (connect the Instagram profile to a Facebook page, convert to Instagram business) by following indication of the different modal dialogs</li>
                    <li>We can already see a rise in Instagram accounts with a publishing method defined.</li>
                </ul>  
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <h2>What’s next?</h2>

                <p class="margin20">We’ll keep monitoring the success rate to define a publishing method for Instagram users. Since the Instagram API is constantly changing, we need to ensure the process is still relevant and clear, e.g., since a few weeks, reels can be published automatically through third-party tools like Levuro. It means that we need to identify whether it requires any changes in the user flow and how to integrate this new functionality in this process, how to make users aware of it, and possible modification or creation of help articles.
