                    <p>
                        Levuro is a social media management tool that allows users to manage their social media 
                        (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, Youtube) in one place. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through user feedback, we noticed that teams using Levuro could not use the tool 
                        efficiently to collaborate: asking for review or feedback on the post they wrote. 
                        Instead, they used long chains of emails or online text editors with comments, 
                        making the process long and tedious. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We designed a new feature to allow users to exchange instant messages to communicate about their work. Users can easily ask their teammates to review their social media posts and get feedback.

                <p>
                    During this phase, I interviewed eight users to understand their way of working and needs. 
                    I also interviewed users working alone to see if they could also have a need for this feature.

                    “Sometimes my manager will review my posts. We do that by email, and I hate it. 
                    It’s a tedious process. Sometimes I can't see the changes because he forgot to highlight it.
                     I lose track. If there is a way to do that in Levuro that would be great.”

                    I analyzed four direct competitors that allow teams to collaborate on their tools. 
                    It helped me gain insights into how each company designed their feature and possibly 
                    identify opportunities for how to create a better solution.

                            It keeps it light but doesn't allow collaboration since
                             it's only a single note on the media.
                        </li>
                        <li>None of the platforms have a system where

                    the different ways users could use the collaboration feature tool. Some use cases came 
                    directly from our users. Clear use cases help frame my work by understanding how users will

                    I made two prototypes to help the team to get an idea of how the collaboration 
                    in Levuro could work. And help choose the direction to go before validating with user testing.

                    <li>Should we offer the possibility for users to write notes/comments next 
                        to the post they are writing, with the option for teams to communicate with 
                        a chat (similar to google docs)?

                    introduced notifications to alert users of any new notes/comments.

                <p class="margin20">Since the free version of Levuro includes an unlimited 
                    number of users per workspace, we needed a strong collaboration feature 
                    to allow teams to do their best work directly inside Levuro. Eliminating 
                    the need for an additional tool.

                    <li>Since the implementation of this collaborative feature, <span class="bold">new accounts with
                         multiple users increased by 15%.</span></li>
                    <li>User feedback revealed that <span class="bold">most teams are now giving each other feedback 
                        in Levuro instead of using emails.</span></li>

                        and an active use of this new feature.</li>

                    implementation by the development team. We review in detail the prototypes 
                    in Figma. Going deep into the details, we usually find missing parts 
                    or questions that need to be answered. I check each part of the 
                    implementation to make sure everything is working as it should.

                <p class="margin20"><span class="bold">Release the feature in the beta version</span> where we can correct bugs
