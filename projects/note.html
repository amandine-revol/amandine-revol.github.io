                    During this phase, I interviewed eight users to understand their way of working and needs. 
                    I also interviewed users working alone to see if they could also have a need for this feature.

                    directly from our users. Clear use cases help frame my work by understanding how users will

                <p class="margin20">The vertical toolbar was adopted, allowing the composer to stay clean and 
                    organized. We also defined how Notes should look in the feed and calendar 
                    views. We extended the concept to the composer to remain consistent. We also 
                    introduced notifications to alert users of any new notes/comments.

                <p class="margin20">Since the free version of Levuro includes an unlimited 
                    number of users per workspace, we needed a strong collaboration feature 
                    to allow teams to do their best work directly inside Levuro. Eliminating 
                    the need for an additional tool.
                </p>

                <ul class="square">
                    <li>Since the implementation of this collaborative feature, <span class="bold">new accounts with
                         multiple users increased by 15%.</span></li>
                    <li>User feedback revealed that <span class="bold">most teams are now giving each other feedback 
                        in Levuro instead of using emails.</span></li>
                    <li>Existing accounts with multiple users showed <span class="bold">more time spent on the tool</span> 
                        and an active use of this new feature.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="margin20"><span class="bold">Implementation by the development team:</span> The next step is the 
                    implementation by the development team. We review in detail the prototypes 
                    in Figma. Going deep into the details, we usually find missing parts 
                    or questions that need to be answered. I check each part of the 
                    implementation to make sure everything is working as it should.

                <p class="margin20"><span class="bold">Release the feature in the beta version</span> where we can correct bugs 
                    and make adjustments from user feedback before the final release.

                <p class="margin20"><span class="bold">Keep iterating and improving</span> the feature based on user feedback and business strategy.
